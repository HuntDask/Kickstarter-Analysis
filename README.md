# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
For our analysis project, we examined Lousie and her theater play Fever which is trying to reach its fundraising goal. In our challenge, we looked at different campaigns that were similar to Lousises play and their specific launch dates and funding goals to see if their was any correlations and further analysis to study. 
### Purpose
Our purpose of the project was to create and reorganize tables and graphs looking at launch dates and their goals to help Louise reach her desired end goals for her play. Looking at these different characteristics will help us determine the best plan of action to reach our fundraising goal accordingly. 
## Analysis and Challenges
For our analysis, we specifically looked at the outcomes based on goals and the outcomes based by launch date. To examine, we create separate sheets in our excel file from the Kickstarter Challenge. These sheets represented the launch dates and goals that we were trying to further study for trends. Our challenges came from forming the very detailed tables and graphs using pivot-tables and pivot-charts. It was a very detailed and thorough project that required us to look at very large files of data and decompress them into smaller data so we could analyze more efficiently.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
During our first analysis, we aimed to look at the outcomes by launch date of each campaign and how they correlated directly with the outcomes they had as a campaign. We separated each category by month over the course of a year and the number successful, failed, and canceled campaigns on a dotted line graph to look at the trends per outcome.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
During our second analysis, we aimed to look at the pricing goals of each campaign and how they correlated directly with the outcomes they had as a campaign. We separated each category from pricing and the number successful, failed, and canceled in order to discover trends in pricing to outcome. We created a chart and a line graph to further look at the goals and there connection with pricing.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not find this campaign analysis project to have too many challenges and difficulties. I believe it was a very tedious challenge so it was a lot of focusing and creating the right graphs and tables to help depict our findings and further analysis. The Kickstarter Challenge data was a spreadsheet with over 5000 campagins, so it was a big amount of data to trim down and inspect the launch dates and goals we wanted to study, but overall I think I was very efficient in my findings for this challenge.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

the first conclusion that we can see from looking at both our Pivot-table and Pivot-chart is that May-June is the most successful time to launch a start up campaign. This will allow us the best chance to reach our fundraising goals if we start our campaign during these months. 
The second conclusion that we can examine is that Winter time is the worst time to start a campaign. From November to February are the worst months out of the year to start the campaign. This is important to know because we need to make sure that we fundraise at the right time for our best chance to succeed.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The first conclusion from the outcomes based on goals is that we have a 76% chance of succeeding our campaign goals if we are having a goal that is 1000 or less. It is important to note that it starts sloping down all the way until we get to 30000$ so our chances decrease as we start to add more money to our fundraising goal.
The second conclusion is that from 15000 to 35000 the percentage of failed campaigns are all over 50%, and reach as high as 80% in the 25000$ range. It shows that to have the best chance of being successful we need to look at our fundraising goals in a short price or a exponentially large price with 45000 or more. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation that we can see clearly from the Outcomes Based on Goal chart is that we are not able to see much information about the Percentage Canceled. We do not know the reason as to why we have these canceled percentages and it is important to learn from the mistakes that other campaigns and act accordingly. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

One table and graph that we could potentially research to better our analysis is the average donations per fundraising campaign and how they correlate with the success of the goals. If it is a very low/high average donation it could have a difference that we do not originally see from our original Kickstarter data set.
Another table and graph setup we could create for our research is examining the years as to which the campaigns were created and the outcomes of it. We looked at the months and totaled those to find the percentages of successful or failed, but a difference in success could depend on which specific year they were started. Each year the economy is in a different standing, different trends are occurring, and these simple examples could have a big factor in the outcome of these various fundraising campaigns.
